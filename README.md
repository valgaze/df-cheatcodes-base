## Overview

df-cheatcodes-base is a library exposing useful aliases, shortcuts, functionality/[sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) that will help teams **quickly** iterate on conversational experiences with DialogFlow.

The big idea is to make it simple and **fast** to quickly iterate on conversational experiences.

This library can be used stand-alone (no peerDependencies) or with the main **[df-cheatcodes bundle](https://github.com/valgaze/df-cheatcodes.)** On its own, it can be useful for building conversational interfaces

## Other Components

### df-cheatcodes

- **Details:** **[https://github.com/valgaze/df-cheatcodes](https://github.com/valgaze/df-cheatcodes)**

_Most helpful for "backend"/server stuff, collection of helpers and docs to augment the actions-on-google library. Generally the idea is to make working with rich components, contexts, data, 3rd-party APIs, and other tasks faster & easier_

### df-starter-kit

- **Details:** **[https://github.com/valgaze/df-starter-kit](https://github.com/valgaze/df-starter-kit)**

_Fully-loaded DialogFlow "starter" project with an agent, fulfillment template, and a frontend that renders rich components. Also has various ergonomic features to speed development like live-reload, types, tunneling, easy deploy/bundling to a web server or optimized for cloud functions_

### df-frontend-vue

- **Details:** **[https://github.com/valgaze/df-frontend-vue](https://github.com/valgaze/df-frontend-vue)**

_A fun "retro" DialogFlow frontend interface that can render rich components with many conversational design & debugging tools._
